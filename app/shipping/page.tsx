      <h2>1. When shipping happens</h2>
      <p>
        Medication ships only if a U.S.-licensed provider issues a prescription and a licensed pharmacy fulfills that
        prescription. Completing intake or authorizing payment does not guarantee a prescription or shipment.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Who ships</h2>
      <p>
        Fulfillment and shipping are handled by licensed pharmacy partners, not by {site.dba} as a pharmacy. Packaging
        and labeling are determined by the dispensing pharmacy and may differ from illustrative website imagery.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Shipping method</h2>
      <p>
        When prescribed, eligible orders are typically shipped via expedited courier in discreet packaging. Temperature
        control (such as cold-pack shipping) may be used when appropriate for the medication. Exact methods may vary by
        pharmacy, destination, and product.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Timing</h2>
      <p>
        Delivery timing is not guaranteed. Delays may occur due to clinical review, pharmacy preparation, carrier
        issues, weather, address problems, or other factors outside our control.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Address accuracy</h2>
      <p>
        Provide a complete, accurate shipping address. Failed delivery attempts caused by incorrect address information
        may result in delays or additional fees charged by the pharmacy or carrier.
      </p>
